        Lots Of Different Personalities, But All Part Of The Same Family Character and comfort, woven together by the
        spirit of the neighborhoods we call home. We’re a family of unique
        hotels all across this big, beautiful world. Welcome to our Neighborhood.<br><br>
        Great design tells stories. From original architecture on full display, to subtle details that invite a second
        glance, each of our unique hotels across the world is a celebration of its neighborhood, telling the stories of
        its people, places, and traditions. We curate spaces and experiences that illuminate the beauty in each of our
        neighborhoods — even if you never leave the hotel.
        <br><br>Whether soaking up inspiration in a cozy nook or soaking in the view from a rooftop pool, we welcome
        everyone. At Hotel Indigo you'll find inclusive environments and flexible spaces buzzing with the neighborhood's
        spirit. Places that restore as much as they inspire, where you can live on your own terms and create an
        experience that’s as individual as you are.
        <br><br>Installations by local artists, ingredients sourced from nearby family farms, events put on in
        partnership with the people that call our neighborhoods home — we celebrate the tastes and traditions of the
        communities we’re a part of, and work to make a positive impact on them in return. After all, it’s their stories
        that have helped form our own.
